# knoot

**Your team's agents share what they know — and are told when what they know
has stopped being true.**

A fact one agent worked out reaches the next one on the turn it opens the same
code, without anyone running a command. A fact names the files it is about, so
when a colleague changes one of them the fact is flagged *possibly stale* and
says who moved it. What a session is doing right now reaches every peer in the
same part of the repo before their paths overlap. And because the same hook sees
every write, the rare moment two agents do meet on one file is caught before
git would report it.

**If knoot breaks, your agents do not know.** Every failure path ends in an
allowed write: relay unreachable, token refused, daemon dead, key missing,
memory unreadable — the agent is told nothing and carries on. That is enforced
by tests that fail the build if it stops being true, and it is why this can be
installed on a repo people are actually paid to work in.

Code never leaves your machine. Only paths, intent sentences, and the facts
somebody chose to publish cross the wire — and under the `mls` provider the
relay cannot read even those.

## Shared memory

```sh
knoot remember --name money --path src/billing.js "all money is integer cents; never floats"
```

That is the whole interface for the person writing. For the agent reading there
is no interface at all: on its next turn in `src/billing.js`, or anywhere under
it, the fact is on its brief.

**This is measured, not hoped.** Four Haiku agents were given a billing task on
a seeded repo that computed tax in floats. Nothing in the seed, the goal or the
task list mentioned cents; the one fact above had been placed in memory. It
reached three of the four unasked, and `billing.js` came out as

```js
// Invoice calculation. All money values are in integer cents.
const tax = Math.round(afterDiscount * taxRate);
```

with `discountCents`, no `parseFloat`, and a passing test called *"Money uses
cents (no floats)"*. The weakest model in the room changed what it wrote because
of something a teammate knew. (The same lab found the opposite for anything
behind a command: agents told outright to run `knoot who` or `knoot plan` did
not. Memory works because it is pushed.)

### Three kinds, one shape

| | what it is | who writes it | lives |
|---|---|---|---|
| **facts** | a durable statement written on purpose — a convention, a decision, a gotcha | a person or agent, `knoot remember` | 90 days, superseded chains kept |
| **repo_cache** | something derived: where a symbol lives, how the tests run | `knoot cache` | 14 days, **dropped** the moment its files change |
| **session_context** | what a session is doing now, and what it has settled | the daemon, every turn; `knoot plan` to say more | the session |

```sh
knoot cache --name "how tests run" --path test.js "node test.js"
knoot plan --path src/billing.js --decided "cents, not floats" "rewriting the tax rounding"
knoot recall                                       # what this repo knows
```

Every kind is scoped to an area of the repo, sealed on the machine that wrote
it, and carries the person who wrote it — taken from their device key, not from
what their client says about itself.

### Knowing when a fact has gone wrong

A memory system that knows when a fact was written can tell you it is old. One
that knows which files it is about can tell you it is **wrong**, and name the
person who made it so.

Every fact records the paths it is about and a hash of each as it stood. A
later write to one of those files marks the fact *⚠ possibly stale: priya
changed src/billing.js since* — unless the file was written back byte for byte,
in which case nothing was invalidated and the flag stays quiet. Facts are
flagged and still shown, because a human wrote them on purpose and "who changed
this" is exactly what the reader needs. Derived knowledge is simply dropped: it
was mechanical, it is now wrong, and it is cheap to work out again.

Writing the same `--name` again **supersedes** the earlier statement rather
than standing beside it, so two agents contradicting each other produce one
current answer and a record of what changed. It is never a dedupe: the case
that matters is precisely a near-duplicate that says the opposite.

### What a session is doing, without asking it

Nobody has to run anything for `session_context`. Every turn, the daemon
publishes what a session appears to be doing, composed from the intent it
declared and the files it holds — both already on the log before the composer
runs, so nothing new leaves the machine and nothing is summarised. It is marked
as composed, and reads that way to a peer: *appears to be working on*, not a
plan they wrote.

`knoot plan` is what a capable agent adds on top. An intent is one line scraped
from a prompt; a plan says what the approach is and what has already been
settled, which is what stops a peer designing against work in progress. Once a
session declares one, the daemon stops composing for it — a scrape must never
overwrite a plan. Either way it appears at the top of every same-area session's
next turn, and it is deleted the moment the session ends: a finished plan
presented as a live one is worse than no plan.

### What is never published

Publishing is **refused**, and the attempt logged, when the text or its source
file looks like a credential — anything `.gitignore`d, `.env*`, `*.pem`,
`*.key`, `id_*`, a token prefix this project recognises, or a long unbroken
key-shaped string. Nothing is derived from a transcript, ever: a free-text
conclusion pulled out of a turn is an exfiltration path with no reviewer, and
no amount of care about what gets extracted fixes that.

### Who can read it

Facts are sealed on the machine that writes them, through a key provider. The
relay chooses, because sealing is a property of the deployment:

- **`plaintext`** (default) stores shards readable. Right for a relay inside
  your own network, where the box is the trust boundary. An integrity tag still
  catches a store that swaps or loses rows.
- **`mls`** (`KNOOT_KEY_PROVIDER=mls` on the relay) makes each room an MLS
  group (RFC 9420, via OpenMLS). Each machine is a leaf; the key for an area's
  memory is exported from the group and sent nowhere. The relay is the
  Delivery Service — it orders handshake messages and can read neither those
  nor a single shard. Removing someone moves the room to an epoch their laptop
  cannot derive.

`knoot status` says which provider is in use, and tells you when this machine
is still waiting for a room's key.

## Nothing sits behind a command

The mechanism under all of this is one hook, fired on every turn, that puts
onto the agent's context what it would otherwise have to ask for:

- **what your peers are doing** — their plans, declared or composed, with the
  files they are in and what they have settled
- **what the team knows** — facts about the files this session has read or
  claimed, each with its author and any staleness flag
- **what has already been worked out** — cached answers about those files
- **what moved under you** — files this session read that a peer has since
  written, before the next write rather than at merge
- **who is here** — every session and person on the repo, their branch, and
  what they hold
- **mail** — anything a peer or a release notification has for you

Pushed context works on the weakest model; offered context is ignored by it.
That is the single finding every part of knoot is built on. `knoot who`,
`knoot recall` and `knoot msg` still exist for people and for capable models,
and nothing depends on them.

## Agents

Two agents speak knoot's hook surface natively, with no MCP server and no
tool the model has to think to call:

| | edits | reads | hooks file |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `Write` / `Edit` / `MultiEdit` / `NotebookEdit` | `Read` | `.claude/settings.json` |
| **Codex** | `apply_patch` — one patch, several files | the shell | `.codex/hooks.json` |

`knoot init` writes both files, committed alongside `.knoot.toml`, so a clone
is enrolled for whichever agent the person who cloned it runs. Codex asks you
to trust a repository's hooks once — `/hooks` inside Codex — and `init` says
so. `knoot init --agent codex` or `--agent claude` writes one.

The two are one room. A Codex session holds a file through a patch and a
Claude Code session is denied it with the same brief — holder, intent, lease.
A fact one wrote reaches the other on its next turn. A Claude Code session's
plan appears at the top of a Codex session's next prompt.

Three things had to be true of the Codex adapter that were free with Claude
Code:

- **A patch is checked as a unit.** One `apply_patch` may add, edit, move and
  delete several files. Every path is tested against the mirror before any is
  claimed, so a patch denied on its third file leaves no claim standing on its
  first two — and `knoot why` never shows a session holding files it never
  wrote.
- **Deletions are announced once they have happened.** A patch that deletes
  a file is recorded as a write before and as a removal after, and only if the
  path is really gone: a patch that failed deleted nothing.
- **Reads through the shell count.** Codex has no read tool; it runs `cat`,
  `sed -n`, `grep`. A write is stale when what the agent read has since
  changed, so those reads are parsed out of the command before it runs and
  recorded — for Claude Code too, where auto mode prefers the shell. Only
  paths that exist in the repo are recorded, and a read is advisory; it never
  denies anything.
- **Codex's sandbox blocks every socket, so messages go through a file.**
  Codex runs the agent's own shell commands under a policy that permits writes
  in the workspace and refuses every connect, unix or TCP — measured, not
  assumed. Hooks run outside it and work; `knoot msg` from inside it fails
  with *Operation not permitted*, and a live Codex session concluded knoot
  was off. So the Codex brief says that is not what it means, and says how to
  message instead: write the text to `.knoot/outbox/<user>` (or `all`) with
  the edit tool, and the next hook — any hook — sends it and removes the file.
  `init` adds `.knoot/` to `.gitignore`. The CLI now tells a refused connect
  from a missing socket, so a healthy daemon is never reported as not running.
  Claude Code's shell reaches the daemon and its brief carries none of this.

Run live on 13 September 2026 — Codex CLI 0.154 and Claude Code on one file,
against a real relay — Codex saw the peer from its turn-start brief before it
was blocked, re-planned on the denial, matched a convention planted in memory,
and after the fix coordinated through the outbox on the first try. The
transcript quotes are under gap 8 in [GAPS.md](GAPS.md).

Which agent is calling is stated on the installed command line (`knoot hook
--agent codex`) and, failing that, inferred from the payload — Codex's carries
`turn_id` and `apply_patch`, Claude Code's carries neither. Everything below
the shim is identical: one daemon, one relay protocol, one log. Adding a third
agent is a matcher, a payload shape, and a test file.

## What crosses the wire

The rule is that **code never leaves your machine**. The relay sequences and
stores what it is given; it should never be given anything worth stealing.
What it is given, exhaustively — every field on every event and message in
`src/proto.rs`:

| leaves the machine | never leaves |
|---|---|
| repo-relative **paths** of files claimed, written, read-and-gone, created or removed | file **contents**, in any form |
| the **repo id** (derived from the `origin` URL) and the **branch** name | diffs, patch hunks, `Write` bodies |
| **session ids**, and the **person** behind them (from the device key) | shell **commands** — parsed locally; only the paths they touch are sent |
| an **intent**: the first 160 characters of each prompt | tool **output** (`tool_response`) — never read |
| **messages** sent with `knoot msg`, in your own words | the **transcript** — Codex sends its path; knoot never opens it |
| **facts, plans and cache entries** somebody chose to publish — sealed on your machine, unreadable to the relay under `mls` | what a session *read* — kept in the daemon, never sent |
| a SHA-256 of each file a fact names, inside the sealed shard | which lines changed, or how many |

Two of those deserve a second look. The **intent** is prompt text: if someone
pastes a stack trace into their first line, its first 160 characters reach
peers. That is the one field that carries what a person typed, and it is
capped and truncated for exactly that reason. And **facts** are whatever an
agent or person wrote on purpose — which is why publishing is refused when
the text or its source file looks like a credential, and why nothing is ever
derived from a transcript.

`the_transcript_and_tool_response_are_never_read` in `tests/codex.rs` asserts
the second column on the bytes the relay stored, not on intent.

## Quick start

```sh
cargo build --release            # → target/release/knoot
# or take a prebuilt one from the nightly release: Linux x86_64 (static),
# macOS Apple silicon, macOS Intel — put it on PATH as `knoot`

knoot relay --listen 0.0.0.0:7420   # one shared relay (any box, or localhost)
knoot daemon                        # one per machine
cd your-repo && knoot init          # writes .knoot.toml + installs Claude Code hooks
```

Restart your Claude Code sessions in that repo. Then:

```sh
knoot who      # who's active, what they're doing, what they hold
```

On a repo big enough that "everyone" is the wrong audience, divide it into
areas — the unit of who can collide with whom. A room grants `(repo, area)`
pairs, and a session is only told about work in the areas its key was granted.

```sh
knoot areas                                 # what this repo's subtrees are
knoot areas --import-codeowners --write     # take them from CODEOWNERS
```

Declaring none is the normal case and means one area, `/`, holding the whole
repo — exactly how every repo behaved before areas existed.

## When two agents do meet on one file

The same hook that carries memory sees every write, so the case memory is meant
to prevent is caught when it happens anyway.

```
agents ──hooks──► knoot hook ──unix socket──► knootd ──websocket──► knoot relay
 (any terminal)     (shim)                    (local mirror)        (sequencer + arbitration)
```

- Every turn's writes auto-claim the touched files (10-minute leases, renewed
  on activity, expired on crash — nothing can wedge the repo).
- Before an edit, the hook checks the local mirror (microseconds) and acquires
  through the relay (single-digit ms). A conflict on the **same branch** returns
  a **conflict brief** — who holds the file, what they are doing, how long is
  left — into the model's context so it re-plans instead of colliding. On a
  **different branch** nothing is blocked: the brief says these files will meet
  at merge, which is a merge conflict predicted hours before git reports it.
- **A write is also checked against what the agent read.** A file it read and
  reasoned about, that somebody else has since changed, is reported before the
  next write — even when the file being written is nobody's. That is the half
  of a conflict a lock cannot see, and it is advisory.
- **Creations, deletions and duplicate tasks are reported too.** Two agents
  creating one new file, a file deleted under someone who had read it, a peer
  who declared the same task — the collisions a claim on an existing path is
  blind to.
- **Widely-shared files are queued, not owned.** A path several sessions want
  inside half an hour, or one named in `hubs` in `.knoot.toml` such as
  `package.json`, gets a two-minute lease and a denial that says how many are
  ahead of you.

In six lab runs with roles assigned, no unforced collision occurred: given
lanes, agents stay in them. The block exists for the day they do not, and the
evidence so far is that awareness prevents the collision before the lock has to.

## Working with people, not only agents

Claude Code sessions announce themselves through hooks. Anyone else — a
teammate in VS Code, an agent under another tool — is invisible unless they say
so:

```sh
knoot present --doing "rewriting the tax rounding by hand"
```

You appear in `knoot who` as a **person**, files you touch are held while you
are in them, and anything addressed to you prints as it arrives. Agents are
told something different about you than about each other: a person cannot be
asked to release a file, so their brief says to pick different work rather than
to wait.

## Sessions talk to each other

Blocking alone is not multiplayer. A blocked session used to wait on a lease it
could not observe, and nobody told it when the work finished.

**Release notifications.** Being denied registers interest in that path. When
the holder releases it — explicitly, by ending, or by its lease expiring — every
waiter is told, with what the holder was doing. Delivery uses the `Stop` hook:
the moment an agent tries to end its turn, pending news sends it back to work,
so notice arrives in real time rather than whenever the human next types. A
per-user cap means a chatty peer can never keep a session spinning.

**Direct messages.** Agents coordinate in their own words:

```sh
knoot msg priya "auth.js is yours, exports are stable"
knoot msg all "goal is green, stop editing"
knoot inbox                    # read and clear pending notes
```

Identity comes from `KNOOT_USER` (else `$USER`), not from a session id — Claude
Code exposes no session id to the commands it runs, and assuming otherwise
attributed every message to the OS user.

## Why is this file like this?

```sh
knoot why src/response.js
```

```
src/response.js
    2m ago  sam@example.com set out to: normalise the error shape in response.js
    2m ago  sam@example.com took it — "normalise the error shape in response.js"
    2m ago  sam@example.com wrote it
    1m ago  priya@example.com was blocked; sam@example.com held it
    1m ago  sam@example.com said: "taking response.js, about 10 min"

what the team knows about it:
  [facts] error-shape
    errors are {code, message}; never a bare string
```

Every event has always been on the log; this reads it back as one file's story
— the claims, the denials, what people said to each other, and what the team
has since decided about it.

## Shell writes

Bash is gated too, or the scheme would be optional: agents reach for `sed` and
heredocs as readily as the Edit tool, and auto mode prefers Bash outright.

`PreToolUse` parses the command for write targets — redirects, heredoc
targets, `tee`, `sed -i`, `cp`/`mv`, `rm`, `dd of=` — and gates each one.
Quoting is respected, and heredoc *bodies* are skipped: a body containing
`(sum, i) => sum + i` would otherwise read `=>` as a redirect.

What the parser cannot read — interpreters, build tools, anything unknown — is
allowed but *audited*: the working tree is fingerprinted before and after, and
any change landing on a peer's claim is recorded as `UngatedWrite`. That is
detection, not prevention, and the dashboard labels it that way.

## Enrolling a team

```sh
knoot init --relay wss://relay.example.com/ws   # once, by one person
git add .knoot.toml .claude/settings.json .codex/hooks.json && git commit
```

All three files are meant to be committed. The hooks call `knoot` **by name**, so
they resolve on every machine that has the binary on `PATH` — set `KNOOT_BIN`
if yours lives somewhere unusual. Each teammate then needs three things: the
binary, `knoot daemon` running, and `knoot login` if the relay requires a
token.

Because knoot fails open, a broken install looks exactly like a quiet one from
inside an agent. `knoot status` is how a human tells the difference:

```
$ knoot status
[ok  ] binary    /usr/local/bin/knoot
[ok  ] repo      /Users/you/project (id: project-4f2a1c)
[ok  ] hooks     6 events, resolved from PATH
[ok  ] daemon    responding
[ok  ] relay     wss://relay.example.com/ws (token: present)

coordination is on.
```

Anything less than that prints what is wrong and the command that fixes it.

## Hosting it for a team

The relay is unauthenticated by default, which is right for `127.0.0.1` and
wrong for anything else. Give it a shared secret and it requires one:

```sh
KNOOT_RELAY_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 24) knoot relay --listen 0.0.0.0:7420
```

Each teammate stores that token once, per relay:

```sh
knoot login --relay wss://relay.example.com/ws --token <token>   # ~/.knoot/credentials.toml, 0600
```

`KNOOT_TOKEN` overrides it, for CI and containers. Tokens deliberately do
**not** live in `.knoot.toml`: that file is committed so a clone is enrolled
with no setup, and a secret must never ride along with it.

Use `wss://` off-machine — a bearer token over plaintext is a token anyone on
the path can take. knoot speaks `wss://` directly; terminate TLS with a proxy
in front of the relay, or at your load balancer.

**A relay that refuses you still fails open.** A rejected token means
coordination is off, not that anyone is blocked: the daemon says so once, on
stderr, and every edit is allowed. An operator's auth mistake cannot become an
outage for the team.


### A hosted relay, end to end

`deploy/` provisions one on a fresh Ubuntu droplet — Caddy terminating TLS in
front of a loopback-bound relay, systemd keeping it up, a token generated on
the box and never in the repo:

```sh
scp -r deploy root@<droplet-ip>:/root/
ssh root@<droplet-ip> 'DOMAIN=relay.example.com APEX=example.com bash /root/deploy/provision.sh'
```

Point `A` records for both names at the droplet first; Caddy gets the
certificates itself on the first request. The script is idempotent — re-run it
to deploy a new revision, and it keeps the existing token rather than rotating
it out from under the team. It refuses to claim success without checking that
the relay rejects an untokened request, accepts a tokened one, validates
registration input, and has a replicable event log.

**It downloads the binary rather than building it.** CI publishes a static
musl build to the `nightly` release on every push to `main` — alongside macOS
builds for Apple silicon and Intel, so a laptop need not compile; the provisioner
verifies its checksum and swaps it in only once everything around it is in
place, so a failed download leaves the running version untouched. A 1 vCPU /
1 GB box needs a 2 GB swapfile to link this at all, and would be doing it
while serving the relay it is about to replace. `SOURCE=build` still compiles
on the box if you want that.

Only `/` and `/app` and `/ops` are served without a token, and they are static
shells: the event log, the repo list, the team API, and the websocket all check
it. A browser cannot set a header, so the console takes `?token=` once and
keeps it in `localStorage`.

### Not losing the log

The event log is the product. Two layers, because they fail differently:

- **Nightly snapshots, on the box.** A `sqlite3 .backup` — never `cp`, which
  half-copies a WAL database into one that restores as corrupt — gzipped, 7
  kept. This covers what actually happens: a bad `DELETE`, a corrupted page, a
  mistake.
- **Continuous replication, off the box,** via Litestream, which covers losing
  the droplet: ten seconds of loss rather than a day. It needs object-storage
  credentials, so it turns itself on only once `/etc/knoot/litestream.env`
  exists and says so loudly while it is off — a backup that silently does
  nothing is worse than one you know you do not have.

Litestream reads the write-ahead log, so the relay sets `journal_mode=WAL`
(with `synchronous=NORMAL`, which keeps a disk flush off the claim path). That
is asserted by a test: against a rollback-journal database, replication copies
nothing and reports success.

## knoot.dev

The hosted relay has a front end: [knoot.dev](https://knoot.dev) is the site,
`/docs` the documentation, `/status` a live health check, and `/app` the team
console. The console opens on one **Get started** flow until a repository has
reached the relay — five steps, each ticked from what the relay actually knows:
a live key, a connected repository, a second person — and then on the live
log. Beside it: **Memory**, what the rooms know about a repository, who wrote
each entry and whether it has gone stale; **History**, `knoot why` in a
browser, one file's story in the CLI's own words; and the repositories, keys,
rooms and team behind them. Every path in the log opens its history.

```sh
open https://knoot.dev/app/#signup      # email and password, for a person
knoot init --relay wss://knoot.dev/ws
knoot join <key> --relay wss://knoot.dev/ws   # a device key, for a machine
```

`join` stores the key and then asks the relay who it is for, printing the team,
the member, the rooms and the areas it opens. `login` still exists and still
works; it just believes the key without asking, which was honest when a key
named only a team.

**People and machines authenticate differently, on purpose.** A person signs in
with email and password; that is a Supabase account, and it is what the console
checks. A machine presents a device key minted in the console: resolved
against local SQLite with no network call, because the hot path has to keep
working when everything else is down. The CLI is unchanged and existing keys
keep working.

- **A key names a person, not just a team.** One row per machine per person, so
  the relay can say who wrote something without taking the agent's word for it
  — authorship on every event comes from the key, and `KNOOT_USER` can no
  longer write an event as somebody else. Keys minted before this land in the
  team's `general` room as "unassigned", still working, until an admin attaches
  them to a person.
- **A room is an access group over areas.** People, plus the `(repo, area)`
  pairs they work in; a member's key grants the union of their rooms. Every
  team gets one room called `general` over every repository, so a small team
  never meets the word. `MULTIPLAYER.md` is the design this comes from.
- **Device keys are stored as SHA-256 hashes.** A database dump hands over nothing
  that works, and an existing key can never be shown to you again — only
  replaced. Mint one per machine, so revoking one costs you nothing else.
- **A team cannot address another team's log.** Every repo key is namespaced by
  team id at the two places a repo is named, so two teams can both have a repo
  called `api` and neither can read the other. `tests/teams_api.rs` asserts
  that through the HTTP surface, not of a helper.
- **A team is not an operator.** The lab's terminals are real shells on the
  host, so they require the relay's own configured secret — not merely a valid
  token.
- **You cannot revoke your way out.** The last live device key is refused, and
  so is removing the last person holding one, because there is no recovery path
  and nobody to ask.

The front end is a Vite app in `web/`, built to `web/dist` and embedded into
the binary with `include_dir!`, so your own relay serves all of it with no
second deployment and no CORS: `/` the site, `/docs`, `/status`, `/app` the
console, `/ops` the original single-team operator view.

```sh
npm --prefix web ci
npm --prefix web run build     # required before cargo build
cargo build --release
```

`web/dist` is committed for exactly one reason: `cargo install --git` has no
way to run npm, and a relay that cannot serve its own console is not one
binary. CI rebuilds it on every push, so a stale `dist` cannot ship.

Sign-in needs a Supabase project. Without one the relay still runs and agent
tokens still work; the console simply says sign-in is not configured.

```sh
# the browser bundle, at build time. The publishable key is public by design.
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=… VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=sb_publishable_… \
  npm --prefix web run build

# the relay, at run time — it verifies a signed-in person's access token.
# The secret key never goes near the browser.
SUPABASE_URL=… SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=sb_publishable_… \
  SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=sb_secret_… knoot relay
```

These are Supabase's current API keys. The legacy `anon` and `service_role`
JWTs still work and are still read under their old names
(`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`),
which matters because Supabase retires them at the end of 2026. The two formats
are not interchangeable on the wire: a `sb_secret_…` key is not a JWT, so
sending it as a bearer token is rejected as an invalid JWT. It goes in the
`apikey` header alone, and `src/cloud.rs` has a test for each format.

Apply the migrations in `supabase/migrations` in order. `0001_teams.sql`
creates `teams` and `team_members` behind row-level security, so a browser
holding the publishable key can read only its own team. `0002_invites.sql`
adds `invites` and `accept_invite`, which is how a second person gets into an
existing team — `create_team` refuses a second team per user, so without it a
team is permanently a team of one. Invitations are stored as hashes too, are
good for seven days, and only work for the address they were sent to.

Three places hold configuration, and the split is the security boundary:

| Where | What goes there | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `web/.env` (gitignored) | `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Local development. Vite reads it at build time. |
| GitHub Actions secrets | `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | CI bakes them into the released binary's front end. |
| `/etc/knoot/supabase.env` on the relay host, 0600 | all three, including `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` | The relay resolves team membership at run time. |

The secret key appears in exactly one of those. Anything named `VITE_*` is
compiled into JavaScript that anyone can read, so a secret key must never be
set there.

The `dist/` committed to this repository is built by `npm run build:oss`, which
points Vite at an empty env directory. That keeps one project's keys out of
what `cargo install --git` serves; a self-hosted console simply reports that
sign-in is not configured, and agent tokens work as usual.

## Adding people

A team starts with one person, whoever registered it. On a relay attached to
Supabase, the console invites the rest by email. On a self-hosted relay there is
no sign-in to invite anybody to, so you create the person and hand them a key:

```sh
knoot member add priya@example.com --label "priya laptop"   # prints the key once
knoot member ls                                             # who is here, and their machines
knoot member rm priya@example.com                           # their keys stop; nobody else's change
```

The key is shown once and is not recoverable — send it over something private,
because it speaks as them until revoked. The console's Members tab does the
same thing when the relay has no Supabase behind it.

This matters more than it looks. A key names a *person*, and that is what
authorship on the log, membership of a room, and the provenance on every
memory shard are resolved from. A team where every key named the same human
had rooms and areas that could not mean anything.

## The browser lab

Two live Claude Code sessions in the browser, with the knoot event log beside
them — no tmux required.

```sh
./lab/lab.sh reset     # seed the repo once
./lab/lab.sh web       # opens http://127.0.0.1:7420/lab
```

The relay hosts each agent as a real pty running `claude` with its own
`KNOOT_USER`, bridged to xterm.js over a WebSocket. Output is buffered, so a
page reload replays the session rather than showing a blank screen. Each
terminal's header shows what that agent currently holds, and turns red the
moment it is blocked. The log on the right is the same event stream the CLI
dashboard reads.

Give both agents the same file to see a block:

- **ash** — a long refactor of `src/auth.js` (holds the claim for minutes)
- **priya** — ~30s later, anything touching `src/auth.js`

Plain `knoot relay` spawns no processes; terminals exist only when it is
started with `--lab-dir`:

```sh
knoot relay --lab-dir /path/to/repo --agents ash,priya
```

## The tmux lab

```sh
cargo build --release
./lab/lab.sh              # start (or re-attach)
./lab/lab.sh reset        # wipe repo state + event log, then start
./lab/lab.sh kill         # tear it all down
```

One tmux window: four Claude Code sessions in a 2x2 grid — `ash`, `priya`,
`sam`, `ci-bot` — over a live dashboard.

```
┌── agent: ash ───────────────┬── agent: sam ───────────────┐
│                             │                             │
├── agent: priya ─────────────┼── agent: ci-bot ────────────┤
│                             │                             │
├── knoot watch ──────────────┴─────────────────────────────┤
│ knoot ●  knootlab   4 session(s)  3 claim(s)  blocked 2   │
│ USER      SESSION   INTENT                    HOLDS       │
│ ash       a1b2c3d4  Refactor src/auth.js…     src/auth.js │
│ priya     c9d0e1f2  Add refreshSession…       —           │
│ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
│ 21:02:56  ash       claim   src/auth.js                    │
│ 21:02:56  priya     BLOCKED src/auth.js (held by ash)      │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

`TASKS.md` in the lab repo has four tasks to paste in — the first two collide on
`src/auth.js` on purpose. Wants a terminal at least 150x40; `ctrl-b z` zooms a
pane, `ctrl-b arrow` moves between them.

`knoot watch` works in any repo, not just the lab.

## Testing it with two sessions on one machine

You don't need two OS users. Sessions are distinguished by Claude Code's own
session id; `KNOOT_USER` just gives them readable names in conflict briefs.

```sh
# terminal 1
KNOOT_USER=ash claude

# terminal 2 (same repo)
KNOOT_USER=priya claude
```

Give both an overlapping task ("refactor the auth module"). The second session
to touch a file gets denied with the first session's identity and intent, and
re-plans. Note `$USER` itself must not be overridden — Claude Code resolves its
credentials through it.

Inspect what happened afterwards:

```sh
sqlite3 ~/.knoot/relay.db \
  "SELECT seq, datetime(ts/1000,'unixepoch','localtime'), json FROM events ORDER BY seq;"
```

## What four agents on one goal actually did

`lab/GOAL.md` gives the lab a shared objective — ship an invoice endpoint, four
owners, one codebase — because tasks with no common goal collide only by
accident. Two runs, unprompted behaviour:

- 18–28 messages per run: agents announced ownership, published export
  contracts, corrected each other when messages crossed, and declared done.
- A session asked to edit a file another held did not attempt it. Presence told
  it who held the file, so it sent the holder a patch and offered to wait. The
  collision was avoided *before* the block, which is the better outcome and the
  reason that run recorded no denials at all.
- The tree ended green: `node test.js`, 57–58 passing.

## Tests

```sh
cargo test          # 306 tests, ~20s
```

| Layer | File | What it protects |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | `src/proto.rs`, `src/memory.rs` | path-overlap boundaries, lease expiry, log-replay determinism, staleness and supersession |
| Memory | `tests/memory.rs` | a fact reaches a peer on the next turn unasked; scoped fetch by id; contradiction is a supersession; a `.env` is refused; a composed context never replaces a declared plan |
| Encryption | `tests/mls.rs` | a relay dump yields no plaintext, no secret and no working credential; a removed device cannot derive the next epoch |
| Awareness | `tests/awareness.rs`, `tests/areas.rs` | stale reads, creation collisions, deletions, hubs; one area's events never reach a session outside it |
| Codex | `tests/codex.rs` | Codex's real payload shapes through the binary; a patch checked as a unit; shell reads count; the transcript and tool output never reach the relay; the brief names the outbox and a message left there is sent on the next hook |
| Arbitration | `tests/arbitration.rs` | 400+ concurrent races → exactly one winner; conflict briefs carry holder + intent; repo isolation |
| Failure | `tests/failure.rs` | fail-open on dead daemon, dead relay, unresponsive relay, malformed input; crash recovery via lease expiry |
| Contract | `tests/e2e.rs` | real Claude Code hook payloads through the binary; exact deny/context JSON; latency ceiling |
| Multi-tenancy | `tests/teams_api.rs`, `tests/memory.rs` | registration, token minting/revocation, and that one team cannot read, list, or revoke another's anything — including through the console's `/api/memory` |
| Durability | `tests/failure.rs` | claims and sequence numbers survive a relay restart; the log stays replicable (WAL) |

## Known gaps

- **Attribution under concurrent writes is inferred.** The working tree is
  shared, so a peer's edit lands inside our audit window too. Authorship comes
  from their `FileWritten` event; if that has not arrived yet, an ungated write
  can be attributed to the wrong session. Observed live before the fix.
- **Interpreters are only detected, never blocked.** `python3 -c "open(...)"`
  writes first and is recorded second.
- **Inside Codex's sandbox, knoot's CLI cannot reach the daemon.** Every
  socket is refused there, so `knoot who` and `knoot msg` fail; hooks, which
  run outside the sandbox, carry everything `who` would print, and messages
  go through `.knoot/outbox/`. `knoot plan` and `knoot remember` from inside a
  Codex session are still commands with no way through; the daemon composes a
  session's context on its own, so the plan is covered, and a fact has to be
  written from a shell outside the sandbox.
- **Same-name sessions share a mailbox.** Mail is keyed by user, so two
  sessions running as the same `KNOOT_USER` both receive its notes.
- **Fail-open is ambiguous by design.** An allowed edit and an unreachable
  daemon look identical from the agent's side. Tests use a positive control
  (the relay must hold the claim) to tell them apart; humans should check
  `knoot watch` shows a green dot.

Not testable by the suite at all: whether the conflict brief persuades a model
to re-plan. Live runs say yes so far — one session prepared its patch and
waited rather than writing; another, seeing a peer mid-rename, wrote its
function and flagged that the peer's rename would need to cover it. Neither
attempted a shell bypass. Small N.

## Where this is going

[REPORT.md](REPORT.md) says what is true of the code and every bug found by
running real sessions. [GAPS.md](GAPS.md) says what would make it the best in
its category, with each gap's evidence and what closed it. [DEMAND.md](DEMAND.md)
asks whether anyone wants it, and answers honestly. [MULTIPLAYER.md](MULTIPLAYER.md)
is the design of areas, rooms, memory and encryption, with its sources.

Not planned, on purpose: fleet mode, merge queues, a model in the arbiter, or
symbol-level claims until the log shows file-level is what bites.
