-- knoot invites: how a second person gets into an existing team.
--
-- `create_team` is the only way in today and it refuses a second team per
-- user, so without this a team is permanently a team of one — which is why
-- this function is not optional for multiplayer.
--
-- Neon owns people, so it owns the invite. The relay owns rooms and device
-- keys, and learns about a new person the first time their console session
-- authenticates. Nothing here reaches across.
--
-- Apply after 0001, the same way.
