-- Neon owns people and teams: Neon Auth keeps the accounts in `neon_auth.user`
-- and these tables hang off them. The relay owns the event log and the hashed
-- agent tokens, because those have to keep working when the network does not.
-- The only thing crossing between them is a team id.
--
-- Needs Neon Auth and the Data API enabled on the branch first: that is what
-- creates `neon_auth.user`, the `authenticated` role and `auth.uid()`, which
-- reads the person out of the JWT the Data API was handed.
--
-- Apply with: psql "$(neon connection-string --role-name neondb_owner)" -f <file>,
-- in order, then `neon data-api refresh-schema`.
