//! Members, devices and rooms: who a key belongs to, and what it may enter.
//!
//! `teams.rs` answers "which team does this token speak for". That was enough
//! while a team was one coordination space and authorship was a display
//! string. It stops being enough the moment an access decision or a memory
//! shard's provenance depends on *who* wrote something: a team-wide bearer
//! token names nobody.
//!
//! So a token becomes a **device**, one row per machine per person, and it
//! names a **member**. A **room** is an access group: a set of people and the
//! `(repo, area)` pairs they work in. A member's key grants the union of their
//! rooms' areas, which is the only authorisation question on the hot path.
//!
//! Three properties this module must not lose, all load-bearing today:
//!
//! * **Old keys keep working.** A `tokens` row with no device is migrated to a
//!   device of a synthetic, unassigned member in the team's `general` room. No
//!   deployment needs a flag day.
//! * **It works with no Neon.** Rooms are enforced here, so they live
//!   here. A self-hosted relay gets members and rooms with no cloud at all;
//!   Neon, when present, only tells us a person's email and role.
//! * **It works unconfigured.** The `root` and `local` identities keep their
//!   shape and land in a `general` room over every repo.
