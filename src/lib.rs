/// Install the TLS backend before the first `wss://` handshake.

/// rustls 0.23 refuses to guess a crypto provider when the crate is compiled
/// with more or fewer than one provider feature, and the refusal is a *panic*
/// inside whichever task happens to dial first. In a fail-open system that is
/// the worst possible failure: the daemon's relay task died, every edit was
/// still allowed, and `knoot status` reported the relay as fine because a
/// stored token is all it could see. Coordination was off and nothing said so.
///
/// Idempotent, and safe to call from several tasks at once — losing the race
/// means someone else installed the same provider.
