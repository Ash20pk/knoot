//! Teams and tokens: who a presented token speaks for.
//!
//! A relay with one shared secret can serve one team. Serving many needs three
//! things this module provides: a token that names a team, a stored form of
//! that token which is useless if the database leaks, and a repo namespace per
//! team so one team's event log cannot be read by another's.
//!
//! Registration is open by design — anyone can create a team — so the only
//! defences that matter here are the ones that hold against a stranger: hashed
//! tokens, per-IP rate limiting, and no personal data asked for or stored.
//!
//! A presented key names a *device*, and a device names a *member*: see
//! `rooms.rs` for those and for the rooms that decide which areas a key may
//! enter. This module keeps the two questions that must be answerable with no
//! network at all — which team, and is this secret live.
