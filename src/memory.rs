//! Shared memory: facts a team's agents publish into an area, and read back
//! without asking.
//!
//! The spec here is a failure taxonomy, not a feature list. MemClaw ran
//! multi-tenant shared memory for agent fleets in production and published
//! what broke; every primitive below answers one of its four failure modes,
//! and two of its production bugs are load-bearing comments:
//!
//! | Failure mode | Primitive | Here |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | Unauthorized leakage | scoped retrieval | every access path checks the scope, **fetch-by-id included** — that was MemClaw's leak |
//! | Stale propagation | temporal supersession | a fact names the paths it is about; a write to one marks it possibly stale |
//! | Contradiction persistence | supersession chains | append-only with `supersedes`; **never dedupe before supersession** — that was MemClaw's other bug |
//! | Provenance collapse | provenance | the author comes from the key, is bound into the seal, and is checked at the relay |
//!
//! Everything fails open. A relay that is down, a provider that is missing, a
//! shard that will not open: the result is no memory injected, and never a
//! write that is refused for want of it.
