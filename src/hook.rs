//! The shim a coding agent invokes via hooks. Reads the hook payload on
//! stdin, consults the local daemon over the unix socket, and answers in the
//! hook output format. Every failure path exits 0 with no output: fail open.
//!
//! Two agents speak this surface natively — Claude Code and Codex — and the
//! shim is the *only* place that knows which is which. Both send the same
//! envelope (`hook_event_name`, `session_id`, `cwd`, `tool_name`,
//! `tool_input`, `prompt`, `stop_hook_active`) and accept the same output
//! contract (`hookSpecificOutput` with a `hookEventName`, `permissionDecision:
//! deny` with a reason, `decision: block` on `Stop`). They differ in what a
//! file edit looks like:
//!
//! * Claude Code edits with `Write`/`Edit`/`MultiEdit`/`NotebookEdit`, one
//!   `file_path` each, and reads with `Read`.
//! * Codex edits with one tool, `apply_patch`, whose `tool_input.command` is
//!   a whole patch that may add, update, move and delete several files; it
//!   has no read tool and reads through the shell.
//!
//! So a Codex patch becomes one batched write check, and shell reads are
//! recorded for both. Nothing else differs, and nothing here reads
//! `transcript_path`, `tool_response`, or the body of a patch — see "What
//! crosses the wire" in the README for what does leave the machine.
//!
//! Which agent is calling is stated on the command line (`knoot hook --agent
//! codex`, as `knoot init` installs it) and, failing that, inferred from the
//! payload. An explicit flag wins because inference is a heuristic and the
//! installed configuration is not.
